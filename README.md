# Devices Gone Rogue Challenge
Ever wondered what would happen if you just plug in that seemingly innocent USB you found laying around? Youâ€™re about to find out! In this devices-gone-rogue challenge - should you choose to accept it - you will gain access to traffic data of ~ 1M devices, and will be tasked with finding the devices that, well, misbehave. This challenge, provided by Armis, is fully unsupervised - so put your anomaly belt on and get to it!

# Dataset

# Example

# Evaluation
As this is an unsupervised challenge, the evaluation process will be a mix of classical leaderboard evaluation and in-person review of the models used. <br>
The final score will be composed of(Sorted descendingly by importance):
* **Leaderboard Evaluation**
Your model results will be matched against a prelabeled dataset - this grading will occur as soon as you'll submit your results for evaluation.
* **Explainability**
Why is this observation an anomaly? Does your model produce a confidence level for each result? Can we calculate the level of importance of this anomaly?
* **Innovation**
Use of an non-trivial algorithm. Creation of ingenious useful features. Any other creative ideas could also be credited with extra scores.

# Submissions
Please send us the anomaly scores you received for each device along with your code in a zip file. You can submit the results as many times as you wish.

# ENJOY!
