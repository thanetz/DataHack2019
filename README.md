# Devices Gone Rogue Challenge
Ever wondered what would happen if you just plug in that seemingly innocent USB you found laying around? Youâ€™re about to find out! In this devices-gone-rogue challenge - should you choose to accept it - you will gain access to traffic data of ~ 1M devices, and will be tasked with finding the devices that, well, misbehave. This challenge, provided by Armis, is fully unsupervised - so put your anomaly belt on and get to it!

# Dataset
<a name="Dataset"></a>
We will used devices information and network traffic from several different networks:
* **Devices.csv** - Data of devices and their appropriate type, manufacturer and model.
* **Sessions.csv** - Details of the connections between a device and external or internal hosts,
aggregated by hours (each row aggregates data from several sessions).

## Device Dataset in-depth
### Fields
| Field | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| network_id | A numeric network identifier |
| device_id | A numeric device identifier |
| type | The device type, one of ("MOBILE_PHONE", "TABLET", "PC", "WATCH", "VOIP", "PRINTER", "IP_CAMERA") |
| model | The device model |
| manufacturer | The device manufacturer |
| operating_system_version | The device Operating System Version |

* Other than "network_id", "device_id" and "type" all fields are optional and can be null

### Example
In the snippet below there are 3 apple watch devices and one ipad all from network 0.

## Sessions Dataset in-depth

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| network_id | A numeric network identifier |
| device_id | A numeric device identifier |
| timestamp | The hour for which the sessions data are aggregated |
| host | The domain the device was connected to, if domain is unknown the host ip will be displayed (this field is hashed) |
| host_ip | The ip of the host the device was connected to (this field is hashed) |
| port_dst | The destination port used in the session |
| transport_protocol | The connection protocol - could be TCP or UDP |
| service_device_id | The device id of the destination host that our device was connected to |
| packets_count | Total packets transferred during the aggregated sessions |
| outbound_bytes_count | Total bytes sent during the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_bytes_count | Total bytes received during the aggregated sessions |
| packet_loss | Total packets that were lost during the session |
| retransmit_count | Total packets that were retransmitted during the aggregated sessions |
| latency | Network latency during the aggregated sessions |
| session_count | Count of sessions that this aggregated row holds |
| outbound_packets_count | Total packets sent during the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_packets_count | Total packets received during the aggregated sessions |
| outbound_bytes_max | Max bytes sent in one session of the aggregated sessions |
| outbound_bytes_min | Min bytes sent in one session of the aggregated sessions |
| outbound_bytes_mean | Mean of bytes sent during the aggregated sessions |
| outbound_bytes_median | Median of bytes sent during the aggregated sessions |
| outbound_bytes_stddev | Standard deviation of bytes sent during the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_bytes_max | Max bytes received in one session of the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_bytes_min | Min bytes received in one session of the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_bytes_mean | Mean of bytes received during the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_bytes_median | Median of bytes received during the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_bytes_stddev | Standard deviation of bytes received during the aggregated sessions |
| outbound_packet_size_max | Max packet size sent in one session of the aggregated sessions |
| outbound_packet_size_min | Min packet size sent in one session of the aggregated sessions |
| outbound_packet_size_mean | Mean of packet size sent during the aggregated sessions |
| outbound_packet_size_median | Median of packet size sent during the aggregated sessions |
| outbound_packet_size_stddev | Standard deviation of packet size sent during the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_packet_size_max | Max packet size received in one session of the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_packet_size_min | Min packet size received in one session of the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_packet_size_mean | Mean of packet size received during the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_packet_size_median | Median of packet size received during the aggregated sessions |
| inbound_packet_size_stddev | Standard deviation of packet size received during the aggregated sessions |


* Other than "network_id" and "device_id" all fields are optional and can be null

### Example
In the snippet below there are some row aggregation from network 0.
For example, the first line tells us that device id 35 connected 39 times using TCP to host "ecbb92..." with port 49152 during the hour started at 156507480 (06.08.2019 07:00 UTC). 
During those sessions a total of 260 packets transferred.

# Solution Example
<a name="Example"></a>
Please look for the example.ipynb notebook in the examples directory. There should be a straightforward approach on anomaly detection using the datasets above.

# Evaluation
<a name="Evaluation"></a>
As this is an unsupervised challenge, the evaluation process will be a mix of classical leaderboard evaluation and in-person review of the models used. <br>
The final score will be composed of (Sorted descendingly by importance):
* **Leaderboard Evaluation**
Your model results will be matched against a prelabeled dataset - this grading will occur as soon as you'll submit your results for evaluation.
* **Explainability**
Why is this observation an anomaly? Does your model produce a confidence level for each result? Can we calculate the level of importance of this anomaly?
* **Innovation**
Use of an non-trivial algorithm. Creation of ingenious useful features. Any other creative ideas could also be credited with extra scores.

# Submissions
<a name="Submissions"></a>
Please send us the anomaly scores you received for each device along with your code in a zip file. You can submit the results as many times as you wish.

# ENJOY!
